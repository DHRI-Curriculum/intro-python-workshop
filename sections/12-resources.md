# Python resources

[Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) - An example-driven introduction to Python.

[How to Think Like a Computer Scientist - Python Edition](https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html) - A good intro if you're also interested in learning basic computer science concepts.

[Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) - A fun book that teaches Python while automating some common (and annoying) tasks.

[CodeAcademy: Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3) - An interactive tutorial for learning the basics of Python. (I recommend trying the books above first, as learning to use a text editor or IDE such as IPython or IDLE is an important part of the learning curve.) A good supplemental resource. 

[Hands-on Python Tutorial](https://anh.cs.luc.edu/python/hands-on/3.1/handsonHtml/index.html) - A more exhaustive introductory course to Python by Dr. Andrew N. Harrington; includes video demo downloads and lots of practice activities. It's all free to use!

Filipa's notes: 

- [13 Project Ideas for Intermediate Python Developers](https://realpython.com/intermediate-python-project-ideas/), *Real Python*. This is for people who already have a sense of the basics, but want to get their hands dirty with a little python project. There's a large list of potential projects you can choose from, that range from working with the command line, to GUIs, to the web, and includes minimal directions on examples and how to get started. 

- already mentioned but [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) offers more ways of using beginner and intermediate python skills for making small applications that will streamline daily and mundane tasks like renaming files and searching the web.
